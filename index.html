<!--  with only the container, nothing showed up.  literally only had body and one div with a class of container.  Width was 100%, height auto, display block, background color: black.  But nothing showed.  Then put in p tag with text and it showed.  Lesson 1: container has to have something inside it to showl.-->
<!--  I couldn't get my color to show in the background.  I hadn't put my script tag in yet with the CSS.  Lesson 2: CSS doesn't work unless it's connected with a script tag.-->
<!--  I forgot how to out script tags in.  They go in the head with a link rel.  Lesson 3: Css tags are link rels in the head.-->
<!--  I put the link in, but didn't show.  Had to double check the path.  Lesson 4: make sure file paths are correct.-->
<!--  I finally got it to work when I added my src in the directory path.  Lesson 5: don't think it will work because it looks like it should work.  Know what you are seeing, versus think you know what you are seeing.  Understand the problem-->
<!--  I wanted to add a background image.  I had to look at the syntax.  I know atom autocompleted background-image:url(). I knew I had to put the src file path in there, but I didn't know if it needed quotes.  Lesson 6: it's needs quotes.  background-image:url("./src/img/photo.jpeg") -->
<!--  I couldn't get my css to show a background image.  So to test it I commented out the background-image and changed it to background-color. The color showed.  This tells me that the html is forming the elements and they have width and height.  So they probably are having a problem getting the images to render. I took the "-" out of the name.  That didn't do anything. I then noticed that I had written background-image: image() instead of background-image:url().  Lesson 7: spelling matters!  Still didn't work, but chrome was now showing that it was being applied.  Read some more.  Found out lesson 8: if it is on a server you have to make sure the permissions (read, write, etc.) will let it show.  Finally got it to show.  Lesson 8: The file had to be a relative path from the CSS file that was defining it, not the html file.-->
